These labels of columns 3 to 81 correspond to the mean of each measurment. For example, column 3 contains
the mean of the tBodyAcc-mean()-X measurment. I used the labels given in the features text file in the 
data files given for the assignment. I only took the measurments for mean, standard deviation, and mean
frequency per the instructions. I chose to add the mean frequency meaurments as well because there are 
only 13 mean frequency values so it does not add too much width to the data frame. 

The run_alaysis.R script first combinds the test and train data in seperate data frames applying appropriate variable names. Then the two data frames are merged together by row. A subset of only the 
mean and standard deviation measurments is created. Activity labels are then applyied to the activities
column, repalcing integers with their respective avticity meaning. Then a subset of that data is created
using the mean of measurments across subject and activity type. More details on the code can be found in
the run_analysis.R scritp and the README.md file.
